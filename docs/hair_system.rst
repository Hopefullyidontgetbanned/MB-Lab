Hair System
===========

The new Hair Engine allows the ability to add particle hair to a MB-Lab character after finalization.


Hair is now parented to armature.
Also added option to add hair from selected polygons.
Now can add unlimited hair objects.

NOTE:

After applying the particle hair, no shader is assigned to it. It is recommended to create a new shader using the Principled Hair BDSF.
